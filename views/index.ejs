                    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                    <p> Warming lives, one vest at a time. The Turtle Shelter Project is devoted to spreading 
                        warmth and preventing Hypothermia for the homeless that do not have the option to stay warm. 
                        Around 700 homeless individuals freeze to death every year, and with these highly developed vests,
                        we will be able to bring that number down to 0. Our goal is to be present all over the world, 
                        and with the help of donations and service minded people, we will reach that goal! Every day is
                        is a day to help others and make a difference.</p>
