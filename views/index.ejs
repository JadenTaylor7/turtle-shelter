                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <p>Warming lives, one vest at a time. The Turtle Shelter Project is devoted to spreading
                    warmth and preventing hypothermia for the homeless that do not have the option to stay warm.
                    We make high tech polyurethane foam vests from the ground up and distribute them in Northern Utah,
                    with plans already in effect to one day distribute vests all over the world! We have a goal to turn 
                    the number of homeless individuals that freeze to death every year from 700 to 0.With these vests, 
                    and the help of donations and service minded people, we will reach that goal! Every day is
                    is a day to help others and make a difference.<br><br></p>
                       
                <h2><b>Our Tech</b></h2>
                <p>Foam clothing technology was invented by outdoor survival expert Jim Phillips. He has done
                    extensive testing using open-cell polyurethane foam as the insulation layer in jackets, hoods,
                    pants, boots, gloves, and sleeping bags. <br><br>


                    Jim Phillips' foam clothing is brilliant technology because of what it can do to help save a
                    person's life in freezing temperatures. The insulation layer foam clothing provides is so
                    effective that even if a person gets wet it will keep them warm -- BUT, wearing synthetic
                    fabrics is an important layer to include with the foam clothing. Foam clothing can be effective
                    while wearing cotton if the wearer stays dry, but if the wearer gets wet, the cotton will absorb
                    and hold water and keep the wearer cold.  If a person is not wearing any cotton with the foam
                    clothing, and they happen to get wet, they will still be able to maintain their core body temperature.
                    The reason why this works is because the shell and lining fabrics and the foam are all synthetic
                    and breathable - providing moisture wicking properties and allowing perspiration and other moisture
                    to evaporate. <br><br>


                    <b>Foam clothing dramatically reduces moisture as being a threat to a person's life in the cold!</b> <br><br>


                    Foam clothing is marketed to emergency preparedness and extreme sports audiences because of its
                    ability to keep you warm in winter conditions.  Being cold is one thing, but being cold and wet
                    is miserable. Being cold, wet, and without shelter can be life threatening. <br><br>


                    This technology is usually sold in emergency preparedness venues and super expensive.
                    It does make sense because the technology is super valuable that the clothing should cost
                    a lot, but we disagree:  nobody likes to be cold and people function a lot better when
                    they are not freezing to death!  So we created a foam vest that covers the core and we
                    called the Turtle Shelter because it acts like a shelter and harnesses the wearer's body
                    heat even while wet and even in freezing temperatures. <br><br>
